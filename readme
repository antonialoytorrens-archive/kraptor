After years of oppression, the slaved people of the world have raised against their masters.
You, has a mercenary pilot, has been contacted by the popular rebellion to fight against the forces of oppression.
In the morning, you jump into your cockpit and start up the engines.
Its time to get airborne and start the attack.
Get ready to scramble the scum hired by the masters.
Murder for freedom is the only way, you're a man on a mission, don't defraud us...
